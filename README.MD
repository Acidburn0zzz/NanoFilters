## Filter Policy

If an issue is taken care by a default (regional) filter, then it will not be fixed again in NanoFilters. 

Ads will be removed unless it is non-intrusive self-promotion. 

Any form of anti-adblock will be removed unless it tests for an auto-starting mining wall. 

Timers and other form of annoyance will be removed if we consider appropriate and if possible. 

Tracking are to be handled in EasyPrivacy or uAssets. 

Third party whitelists must be added to `Nano filters â€“ Whitelist`.
